This is the tic-tac-toe grid

   |   |
---+---+---
   |   |
---+---+---
   |   |

The entire grid is five lines longs
The odd-numbed lines can be repeated
The even-numded lines can also be repeated, but will contain different things inside the cells

Each cell has a number assignmed to it called Cell#
  
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9

To turn cursor postions into Cell#, use this formula
 
 Cell# = ( ( (cx - 2) / 4) + 1 ) + ( ( (cy - 2) / 2 ) * 3)

 P1 is represented as 1 while P2 is represented as -1

 The Grid_State will be a array that can hold nine elements, each location in the array with either be 1 or -1

Every turn, four checks will be performed

If the result of a check is 3, then P1 wins. Likewise, If the result is -3, P2 wins
